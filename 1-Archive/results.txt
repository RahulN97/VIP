Handicap golf carts with drivers to schedule for picking up individuals -- a website to schedule pickup
The Atlanta landscape with long steep hills makes it hard to navigate parts of campus.  Golf carts or other specialized schedulable pickups would help students and faculty/staff navigate campus
Some buildings have doors that are very heavy and hard to push. The elderly or any person who does not have a lot of upper body strength would have a problem with this.
Having to go around campus takes longer and takes much more effort than having handicap accessible routes throughout campus. For example, in order to get from the CULC to the library, any handicapped individual would need to go around campus in order to avoid the stairs even though the buildings are adjacent,
There are many lines near the elevator access which makes it difficult to get to the elevators in the Student Center,
West campus in general is very elevated, and in order to maneuver between buildings, there are many stairs that need to be avoided. These factors together make it hard to get there,
More elevators especially in residential buildings
